### Road Accident Data Analysis - Excel Project 

 ##  Project Overview

This project is focused on analyzing road accident data using **Microsoft Excel**. The purpose of the analysis is to extract insights about different types of road accidents, their frequency, severity levels, and accident distribution across various road types. This project was developed using Excel’s advanced data-handling capabilities such as **Pivot Tables**, **Dashboards**, **KPIs**, and **Macros**.

This project is ideal for demonstrating Excel-based data analysis, particularly for MIS Analyst, Data Analyst, or Business Analyst roles.
